### Decode Dutch Votes! 🗳️

Just like we explored demographics, let's unravel the voting mysteries of 2023's provincial elections.
Get ready to harness the might of `R`'s data manipulation powers!


```{r datavotes, exercise=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
results <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/master/data/dutch_elections_2023ps.csv")
results |>
  filter(gemeente == "Groningen") |>
  arrange(desc(votes))
```

**Challenge Time**:
Above you see voting results for Groningen.
What happens if you remove the `desc(..)` function from arrange, i.e., change `arrange(desc(votes))` into `arrange(votes)`?
Can you now unveil the secrets of Amsterdam's votes, ordered alphabetically by party?
Dive in!

```{r datavotes-solution}
library(tidyverse)
results <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/master/data/dutch_elections_2023ps.csv")
results |>
  filter(gemeente == "Amsterdam") |>
  arrange(party)
```

```{r datavotes-code-check}
grade_code()
```

```{r datavotes-hint-1}
# Pro Tip: To unveil Amsterdam's secrets, change the filter to `gemeente == "Amsterdam"`
```

```{r datavotes-hint-2}
# Two-step guide: 
# 1. Change the filter to `gemeente == "Amsterdam"`
# 2. Let's go alphabetical! Replace 'votes' in the arrange command with 'party'. No need for 'desc(.)' this time!
```

```{r datavotes-hint-3}
# Almost there! 
# 1. Replace with `gemeente == "Amsterdam"`
# 2. And for an alphabetical order, use `arrange(party)`. Here's a starter!
results |> 
  filter(gemeente == "Amsterdam") |> 
  arrange(party)
```

## 🚀 **Unleash the Power of Visual Insights with `R`!**


Get ready to dive deep into `R`'s most engaging visualizations.
Hold onto your seat because we're about to explore the world of data like never before!

```{r data, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
results <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/master/data/dutch_elections_2023ps.csv")
demographics <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/master/data/dutch_demographics.csv")
```

```{r dataprep}
library(tidyverse)
results <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/master/data/dutch_elections_2023ps.csv")
demographics <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/master/data/dutch_demographics.csv")
```

### **_R's Ultimate Visualization Toolkit: ggplot_** 🎨

Hey there, future data scientist!
Do you know one of `R`'s best-kept secrets?
It's `ggplot`.
This isn't just another visualization tool.
With `ggplot`, you don't just "look" at data -- you EXPERIENCE it!
Whether you're an artsy person looking to craft beautiful plots or a logical thinker wanting clear and insightful visuals, `ggplot` has got you covered.

And guess what?
We're going to use the same rich data we discussed earlier.
Ready?
Let's roll!

### 🔍 Your First Hands-on Experience with Scatter Plots 🔍

Scatter plots might seem simple, but they're incredibly powerful.
Imagine being able to see hidden patterns, relationships, and trends in just one glance!

Have you ever wondered how the age distribution differs between cities and rural areas?
Does age correlate with population density?
Let’s find out!

```{r scatter, exercise=T, exercise.setup='data'}
ggplot(
  data = demographics,
  mapping = aes(x = v57_density, y = c_65plus)
) +
  geom_point()
```

Woah, did you see that?
It seems older people tend to live in less crowded areas.
How cool is that?
Notice the elegance of `ggplot`.
We gave it some data, told it how to map the data (with the code inside `aes()`), and BOOM! –- a stunning scatter plot!

💡 **Want to experiment?**
Why not switch variables like `v43_nl` or `v132_income`?
Or maybe add more flair with `color = v43_nl` or `size = v01_pop`.
The sky's the limit!

### 🎨 **Time to Glam Up Your Plot** 🎨

While our first plot was revealing, it's time to amp up its appearance!
Get ready to witness the power of `ggplot`'s customization.
Check out the enhanced version below:

```{r scatterpretty, exercise=T, exercise.setup='data'}
# Basic ggplot
#    - data (demographics)
#    - a mapping of density (y) against income (x), population size (dot size), and migration history (color),
#    - and a geom (in this case geom_point to create a scatter plot)
ggplot(
  data = demographics,
  mapping = aes(x = v57_density, y = v132_income, size = v01_pop, color = 100 - v43_nl)
) +
  geom_point(alpha = .7) +
  # All optional elements to change appearance
  # Add nice titles for the plot and axes
  ggtitle("Differences between rural and urban municipalities") +
  xlab("Population density") +
  ylab("% of people older than 65") +
  # Change the scale for migration history to go from light to dark blue:
  scale_color_gradient(low = "lightblue", high = "darkblue") +
  # Use the scale command to tweak the legend;
  scale_size(
    breaks = c(5000, 50000, 500000),
    labels = c("5.000", "50.000", "500.000")
  ) +
  # Use the guide command to specify titles and direction for the legend
  guides(
    size = guide_legend(
      title = "Population", title.position = "top",
      override.aes = list(color = "darkblue")
    ),
    color = guide_colorbar(
      title = "% with Migration History",
      title.position = "top",
      direction = "horizontal"
    )
  ) +
  # Use the 'classic' theme
  theme_classic() +
  # Tweak the theme to drop the background for legend keys
  theme(legend.key = element_blank())
```

This might seem overwhelming, but here's the secret -- most of these lines are purely aesthetic.
The core essence of `ggplot` remains the same!

🎓 **GGPLOT MASTER TIP**:
The true essence of `ggplot` lies in its layering system.
Start with the basics and then enhance by adding more layers.
Each additional command is like adding a new coat of paint or a unique brushstroke.

::: Info ::::::
**For the Explorers Out There**:
Try removing some lines.
Maybe ditch the theme (`theme_classic()`) in favour of `theme_linedraw` or `theme_void`?
Or even ones from the `ggthemes` packages, that mimics cool styles that are already out there.
Try using `ggthemes::theme_economist` or `ggthemes::theme_tufte`.
Or play with the color scales?
Go wild and create YOUR perfect plot!

### 🔍 Mashing Up Data Like a Pro DJ 🎶

We've all been there -- looking at tables upon tables of data, wondering how they connect.
But what if I told you that, in a snap, you can bring them all together?
That's the magic of `R`!
Let's start with a real-world scenario:
the excitement of election results combined with demographic data!
And guess what? 
The magic word here is `join` and all you need to use it the common key between the data sources (in this case `gm` is referring to the municipality ID in both tables).
Let's get to it!

Let's see how the farmer's party, BBB, did in different places based on how crowded they are:

```{r plot, exercise=T, exercise.setup='data'}
bbb <- filter(results, party == "BBB")
data <- inner_join(bbb, demographics)
ggplot(data = data, mapping = aes(x = log10(v57_density), y = votes, color = party, size = v01_pop)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  xlab("Population density (log scale)") +
  ylab("Relative support for party") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("BBB" = "green", "Anti-immigration" = "blue")) +
  scale_size(guide = "none") +
  ggtitle(
    "Support for BBB and anti-immigration parties per municipality",
    "(Dutch 2023 provincial elections; note: size of point relative to logged municipality population)"
  ) +
  xkcd::theme_xkcd() +
  theme(legend.position = "top", legend.title = element_blank())
```

## 🌍 Mapping Your Way to Stardom!

Ever gazed at a map and thought, “I wish I could make one”?
With `R`, not only can you create a map, you can make it tell stories!

### 🎨 Crafting the Canvas: Shape Files

Hold on to your hats!
To draw a map, we need to know the shape of regions.
It's like coloring but even cooler.
Let's fetch the blueprint for our Dutch map!

```{r loadshapes, include=FALSE, exercise.setup='data'}
library(sf)
if (!file.exists("sf_nl.rds")) {
  library(tidyverse)
  shapes <- read_rds("https://github.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/raw/master/data/sf_nl.rds")
  write_rds(shapes, "sf_nl.rds")
} else {
  shapes <- read_rds("sf_nl.rds")
}
```

```{r datagis, exercise=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
shapes <- read_rds("https://github.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/raw/master/data/sf_nl.rds")
shapes
```

💡 **Shapefiles Explained**: 
Think of shapefiles as the 'outline' you'd use in a coloring book.
They define the borders of regions, like countries or municipalities.

### 🖌 Paint That Map!

To plot the map, use `geom_sf`, it automatically knows how to deal with shapefiles!

```{r plotshape, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='loadshapes'}
ggplot(data = shapes) +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry = geom, fill = provincie))
```

### Combining shapes and demographic information

Sure, maps are cool, but maps that tell stories?
Legendary! Let’s add some sociologically relevant demographic info to our map!
For population density:

```{r gisdensity, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='loadshapes'}
inner_join(shapes, demographics) |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry = geom, fill = v57_density)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "red", guide = "none") +
  ggtitle("Population density per municipality") +
  theme_void()
```

For the support for the BBB party (i.e., who likes the farmer's party, BBB?):

```{r gisbbb, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='loadshapes'}
bbb <- results |> 
  filter(party == "BBB")
inner_join(shapes, bbb) |> 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry = geom, fill = votes)) +
  ggtitle("Support for BBB per municipality") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "green", name = "% Support") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

💭 **Brain Tickler**:
What stories do these maps whisper about the BBB party?
Try plotting for other parties and flex those R muscles!
And hey, why not jazz things up with different colors?


## Simple statisticsts: Unmask the Numbers with `R`

Hey, data detective!
Do you ever look at numbers and think, "What secrets do you hold?"
With `R`, not only can you ask the numbers, but they'll sing you their deepest truths in the tune of statistics!

### 🎡 Dance of the Variables: Correlation

Ever wonder how two things are related? Like, does eating more chocolate really make you happier? (🍫 + 😄 = ?). That's correlation for you! Let's explore how our demographic data variables groove together:

🔗 **The Correlation Quick-Check**:

```{r cor, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='data'}
# Grabbing our key variables!
vars <- select(demographics, v01_pop:c_65plus)

# What's the vibe between them?
cor(vars, use = "pairwise")
```

But hey, why just see numbers when you can visualize the dance?
Enter the `ggcorrplot` package:

```{r corplot, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='data'}
# The visual magic wand!
library(ggcorrplot)

# Dive deeper into the dance of variables.
vars <- select(demographics, v01_pop:c_65plus)
correlations <- cor(vars, use = "pairwise")
ggcorrplot(correlations, method = "circle")
```

💡 **Pro Tip**: Correlation coefficients range from -1 to +1.
The closer they are to these extremes, the stronger the dance bond between variables!


### 🎢 Predicting the Unpredictable: Regression

Regression is employed to understand relationships between variables, particularly how changes in independent variables correspond with variations in dependent ones.
In other words: 
you've seen the dance; now let's predict the future moves!
Can demographics help us predict how the BBB party will fare?
Let's find out!

```{r lm, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='data'}
library(sjPlot)
bbb <- filter(results, party == "BBB")
data <- inner_join(bbb, demographics)
m <- lm(data, formula = votes ~ v57_density + c_65plus)
tab_model(m)
```

```{r lm-solution}
library(sjPlot)
vvd <- filter(results, party == "VVD")
data <- inner_join(vvd, demographics)
m <- lm(data, formula = votes ~ c_65plus + v43_nl + v132_income)
tab_model(m)
```

```{r lm-code-check}
grade_code()
```

Guess what? The denser a municipality, the fewer the votes for BBB. But age? Seems like it doesn't play a part for BBB.

🌟 **Your Turn! Challenge Time**:
Let's shake things up. Predict the VVD's vote share using `c_65plus`, `v43_nl`, and `v132_income`.
What stories do the numbers tell you?
Are they what you expected? 
(Note: Renaming the `bbb` dataset to `vvd` is essential, or the code checker will see it as a mistake.)

🔮 **Final Thought**: With R, you're not just analyzing numbers; you're weaving tales, predicting futures, and unveiling secrets. So, arm yourself with curiosity, and let R be your guide to data enlightenment! 🌌📊🌟
