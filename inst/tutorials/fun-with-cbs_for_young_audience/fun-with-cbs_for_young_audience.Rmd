## Unraveling Dutch Secrets 🕵️‍♂️

Today, we're going on a data adventure to learn about Dutch voters using some cool data from CBS (the people who are paid by the governemnt to bring you Dutch statistics) and voting results from the election board.
Think of it like a treasure hunt, but instead of gold, we're finding knowledge!

Oh, and guess what? R can read `csv` files directly from the internet!
A `csv` file is like a spreadsheet you might see in Excel, with rows and columns of data.

### What's in the Data Box? 🎁

When you run the code below by pressing the `► Run Code` button, you'll see something called a *data frame*.
Think of a data frame as a magic box that holds our data.
Each row is like a different story, and each column is a detail about that story.

In our adventure, each row tells us about a place in the Netherlands called a municipality (or *gemeente* in Dutch).
The columns give us cool facts about each of the places, like how many people live there or how old they are.

Let's take a peek inside the box of the [CBS regional figures](https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/70072ned/table?ts=1691399765879):

```{r datademo, exercise=T}
library(tidyverse)
demographics <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/master/data/dutch_demographics.csv")
demographics
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Somehow shinyapps.io does not always pick up all the dependencies
library(ggcorrplot)
library(xkcd)
library(ggthemes)
library(sjPlot)
```

Hmm, can you guess what each column means?
Don't worry, we'll explain everything!
Click `continue` for a magical tour of our data.

::: Info ::::::
Hey, guess what?
You can't break anything here!
🎉 Every time you press 'Run code', it's like hitting a reset button.
And if you think you've turned your code into a spaghetti mess, just press the `↻ Start Over` button, and it'll be good as new!

### Decoding the Data 🧐

| Column Name     | What It Means                                                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| gm              | A special unique code for each place                                          |
| gemeente        | The name of the place                                                         |

| v57_density     | How packed in or spread out people are                                        |
| v43_nl          | Percentage of people who've always lived in the Netherlands                   |
| v122_disposable | Money left after paying bills (average for each home)                         |
| v132_income     | Average money earned by each home                                             |
| v142_wealth     | The middle amount of money saved by homes                                     |
| v153_uitkering  | Percentage of people getting help from the government (not counting pensions) |
| c_65plus        | Percentage of people older than 65 (like your grandparents!)                  |

### Voting Secrets 🗳️

Now, let's uncover some voting secrets!
We'll load data about how people voted in different places during the 2023 provincial elections.

R has some magical spells (we call them commands or functions) to clean and sort data.
For example, the code below makes R show voting results for a place called Groningen.
But what if you want to see results for Amsterdam?
Or sort (arrange) them differently?
Like what happens if you remove the `desc(..)` function from arrange (change `arrange(desc(votes))` into `arrange(votes)`)?
Try it out!

**Challenge**: Can you tweak the code to show voting results for Amsterdam, sorted by party names (from A to Z)?

```{r datavotes, exercise=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
results <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/master/data/dutch_elections_2023ps.csv")
results |>
  filter(gemeente == "Groningen") |>
  arrange(desc(votes))
```

```{r datavotes-solution}
library(tidyverse)
results <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/master/data/dutch_elections_2023ps.csv")
results |>
  filter(gemeente == "Amsterdam") |>
  arrange(party)
```

```{r datavotes-code-check}
grade_code()
```

```{r datavotes-hint-1}
# Hint: To focus on Amsterdam, change "Groningen" to "Amsterdam" in the filter() spell.
```

```{r datavotes-hint-2}
# Hint: To sort by party names, replace 'votes' with 'party' and remove the 'desc(..)' magic word.
```

```{r datavotes-hint-3}
# Here's a little more help:
results |> 
  filter(gemeente == "Amsterdam") |> 
  arrange(party)
```

The code box above is like a puzzle with one correct solution. Make your changes and click the `☑️Submit Answer` button to see if you got it right. Don't worry if you make a mistake; R will try to help you out. And remember, you can always ask for `💡 Hints` if you're feeling stuck. Keep going, young wizard! 🌟

## Painting with Data 🎨

Alright, young data explorers!
🚀 Let's continue our journey into the world of R.
This time, we're going to create some beautiful art with our data.
Think of it as painting, but instead of brushes and colors, we're using code and data!
R isn't just about numbers and tables; it can also create stunning visuals!
There's this magical tool in R called `ggplot`, which is like a room packed with art supplies to paint your data.
It might seem a bit tricky at first, but with practice, you'll be painting masterpieces in no time!

Let's use the same treasure (data) we found earlier:

```{r data, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(xkcd)
results <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/master/data/dutch_elections_2023ps.csv")
demographics <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/master/data/dutch_demographics.csv")
```

```{r dataprep}
library(tidyverse)
results <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/master/data/dutch_elections_2023ps.csv")
demographics <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/master/data/dutch_demographics.csv")
```

### Your First Data Painting 🖼️

Let's start simple.
Imagine a canvas where you sprinkle dots to see a pattern.
This is called a scatter plot.
Each dot shows you one place in the Netherlands.
On the axis of the plot, you can see details about each place .
For instance, we can check if older people prefer to live in busy cities or quiet countryside areas:

```{r scatter, exercise=T, exercise.setup='data'}
ggplot(
  data = demographics,
  mapping = aes(x = v57_density, y = c_65plus)
) +
  geom_point()
```

Look at that!
It seems older folks prefer less crowded places.
How do I know?
By looking at where the dots are, we can see patterns.
For example, if a dot is painted towards the top left, it means that this place has fewer people packed in (low density), but more of them are older folks.

The code might look like a spell, but it's telling R how to paint our data.
The `ggplot()` function is our canvas, and `geom_point()` is like sprinkling dots on it.
Inside `ggplot()`, we tell `R` which data we use (`demographics`) and where to put our dots using mapping and the `aes` function (`v57_density` decides where a point is on the x axis, `c_65plus` controls where the point is on the y axis)!

Try changing the variables in the code to see different patterns.
What if you wanted to color the dots based on how many people have always lived in the Netherlands (`fill = v43_nl`) or change the size of the dots based on the total population (`size = v01_pop`)?
Or use one of these two variables to change the x or y axis?
Give it a try!

### Making Your Painting Prettier 🌈

The plot above was cool, but let's add some flair! 
The next code might look like a long spell, but it's just adding more details to our painting.
You first construct a basic plot consisting of data, aesthetics, and geoms. 
This already looks cool as we have just seen and matches the data well.
But it's more fun to change the style so that *you* like how it looks.
This is what all the other lines of code are doing:
changing colors, themes and guides.
Let's break it down:

::: Info ::::::
Did you know? 
Lines starting with a `#` are comments.
They're like little notes to ourselves and don't affect the code.
We use them here to find out what the different parts of the code mean.
:::

```{r scatterpretty, exercise=T, exercise.setup='data'}
# Setting up our canvas with data and how we want to display it
ggplot(
  data = demographics,
  mapping = aes(x = v57_density, y = v132_income, size = v01_pop, color = 100 - v43_nl)
) +
  geom_point(alpha = .7) +  # Adding our dots with a bit of transparency
  # Making our plot look fancy with titles and labels
  ggtitle("City vs. Countryside: Where's the Money?") +
  xlab("How crowded is the place?") +
  ylab("Average money earned by each home") +
  # Changing the colors and sizes of our dots
  scale_color_gradient(low = "lightblue", high = "darkblue") +
  scale_size(
    breaks = c(5000, 50000, 500000),
    labels = c("5.000", "50.000", "500.000")
  ) +
  # Adding a legend to explain our colors and sizes
  guides(
    size = guide_legend(
      title = "How many people live here?", title.position = "top",
      override.aes = list(color = "darkblue")
    ),
    color = guide_colorbar(
      title = "% of people who've always lived here",
      title.position = "top",
      direction = "horizontal"
    )
  ) +
  # Choosing a stylish theme for our plot
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.key = element_blank())  # Making our legend look neat
```

Feel free to play around with the code!
What happens if you change the theme or the colors?
Remember, coding is all about experimenting and having fun! 🎉

::: Info ::::::
Themes in `ggplot` are like different outfits for your plot. You can try on different styles to see which one you like best! For a different look, try using `theme_linedraw` or `theme_void`. And if you're feeling adventurous, explore themes like `ggthemes::theme_economist` or `ggthemes::theme_tufte`.

### Mixing Data Potions 🧪

Sometimes, we want to mix data from different sources to create something new.
It's like making a potion!
For our next trick, we'll combine election results with some demographic data.
The magic word here is `join`, which helps us mix our ingredients (since they both contain the `gm` column, they fit together automagically).

Let's see how the farmer's party, BBB, did in different places based on how crowded they are:

```{r plot, exercise=T, exercise.setup='data'}
bbb <- filter(results, party == "BBB")
data <- inner_join(bbb, demographics)
ggplot(data = data, mapping = aes(x = log10(v57_density), y = votes, color = party, size = v01_pop)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  xlab("How crowded is the place? (log scale)") +
  ylab("Support for the party") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("BBB" = "green", "Anti-immigration" = "blue")) +
  scale_size(guide = "none") +
  ggtitle(
    "How popular is BBB in different places?",
    "(Dutch 2023 elections; note: size of dot shows how many people live there)"
  ) +
  xkcd::theme_xkcd() +
  theme(legend.position = "top", legend.title = element_blank())
```

## Crafting Magical Maps 🗺️

Alright, young adventurers!
🌍 We've explored data tables and made some cool paintings with our data.
Now, let's take our adventure to the next level and create some magical maps!
Imagine you're a cartographer, drawing maps of hidden lands.
But instead of drawing mountains and rivers, we'll be painting with data!
But first, we need to know the shape of the places we're drawing.
It's like having a stencil to color inside the lines.

### Map Stencils 📐

To draw our maps, R needs to know the shape of the places.
We call these "shapefiles".
Let's get a shapefile for the Netherlands:

```{r loadshapes, include=FALSE, exercise.setup='data'}
library(sf)
if (!file.exists("sf_nl.rds")) {
  library(tidyverse)
  shapes <- read_rds("https://github.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/raw/master/data/sf_nl.rds")
  write_rds(shapes, "sf_nl.rds")
} else {
  shapes <- read_rds("sf_nl.rds")
}
```


```{r datagis, exercise=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
shapes <- read_rds("https://github.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/raw/master/data/sf_nl.rds")
shapes
```

With our stencil ready, let's start coloring!
We'll use `ggplot` again, but this time with a special tool called `geom_sf` to draw shapes:

```{r plotshape, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='loadshapes'}
ggplot(data = shapes) +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry = geom, fill = provincie))
```

### Painting Inside the Lines 🖌️

Drawing the map is cool, but it's even cooler when we can color it with data!
For this, we need to combine the stencil (our shape data) and demographic information.
After they are `join`ed, we can use diofferent variables to color the map.
Let's see how crowded each place is!

```{r gisdensity, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='loadshapes'}
inner_join(shapes, demographics) |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry = geom, fill = v57_density)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "red", guide = "none") +
  ggtitle("How crowded is each place?") +
  theme_void()
```

Now, let's see how popular the farmer's party, BBB, is in different places:

```{r gisbbb, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='loadshapes'}
bbb <- results |> 
  filter(party == "BBB")
inner_join(shapes, bbb) |> 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry = geom, fill = votes)) +
  ggtitle("Where do people love BBB?") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "green", name = "% Support") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Look at that!
🌟 Can you spot where BBB is super popular?
Try drawing maps for other parties or changing the colors.
Remember, you're the artist here, so let your creativity shine! 🎨

## Unveiling Data Secrets with Simple Statistics 🔮

Alright, young data wizards!
🧙‍♂️ We've painted with data, drawn magical maps, and now it's time to uncover some secrets with statistics!
Think of it as using a crystal ball to see patterns and relationships in our data.

### The Power of Correlation

Let's start by understanding how different things relate to each other.
This relationship is called "correlation". Imagine two dancers moving together; if one moves to the left and the other also moves to the left, they're correlated!

Let's see how our demographic data is dancing together:

```{r cor, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='data'}
vars <- select(demographics, v01_pop:c_65plus)
cor(vars, use = "pairwise")
```

But wait, there's more! We can also visualize these relationships with a cool plot:

```{r corplot, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='data'}
library(ggcorrplot)
vars <- select(demographics, v01_pop:c_65plus)
correlations <- cor(vars, use = "pairwise")
ggcorrplot(correlations, method = "circle")
```

### Predicting the Future (or at least trying to) 🌌

Now, let's play detective and see if we can predict how popular the BBB party is based on some demographic info.
This is called "regression". 
It's like trying to guess what a sketch show when only the first few lines are drawn yet!

```{r lm, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='data'}
library(sjPlot)
bbb <- filter(results, party == "BBB")
data <- inner_join(bbb, demographics)
m <- lm(data, formula = votes ~ v57_density + c_65plus)
tab_model(m)
```

From our crystal ball (or, well, our regression model), we can see that the more crowded a place is, the fewer votes BBB gets.
But the age of the population doesn't seem to matter much.

**Your Turn!** 🌟 Can you change the code to predict how popular the VVD party is based on some other demographic info? 

```{r lm-solution}
library(sjPlot)
vvd <- filter(results, party == "VVD")
data <- inner_join(vvd, demographics)
m <- lm(data, formula = votes ~ c_65plus + v43_nl + v132_income)
tab_model(m)
```

Remember to rename the `bbb` data to `vvd` so our code doesn't get confused. Once you've made your prediction, think about it: Do the results surprise you? What story do they tell?

(Note: This is just a fun exercise, and in the real world, predicting things is a lot more complex. But you're off to a great start!) 🚀
