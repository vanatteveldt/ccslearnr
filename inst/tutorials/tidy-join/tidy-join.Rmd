## Introduction

In many cases, you need to combine data from multiple data sources. 
For example, you might need to combine political results per country or region with demographics of these regions; 
or combine a text analysis of various tweets or other texts with metadata about these texts;
or combine academic performance of students with information about their school or courses.

In such cases, you need to **join** two different data frames, adding the information about a *specific case or group* from one data frame to the information about the *same group* from the other data frame.  

### Joining data

To show how this works, let's assume we are interested in a relation between student performance and class size, and we have a data set about individual student performance and a data set with class sizes per school:

![Figure 1: Data about students and schools](https://github.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/blob/master/data/join1.png?raw=true)

&nbsp;

If we *join* this data, the information on class sizes is added to the information per student:

![Figure 2: Joining data](https://github.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/blob/master/data/join2.png?raw=true)
&nbsp;

There are three things to notice in this process. First, for joining it is essential that the same cases or units can be identified in both data sets. In this case, the `School` column identify which rows in the schools data correspond to rows in the student data set. We say that we **join** the data **by school**. 

Second, in most cases there are multiple rows in one data set for each row in the other data set: there are multiple students in the same school. This results in the school information being copied to each corresponding student.

Finally, in this case the same units (schools) existed in both data sets. This is not always the case: maybe we don't have students in our sample for some schools, or maybe the class size information is missing for some schools. In that case, you must choose which of the information to keep, and which to remove. This is discussed in detail in the last section of this tutorial. 


### This tutorial 

This tutorial will teach you the `inner_join` and other `_join` commands used to combine two data sets on shared columns. 
See [CAC chapter 6.4: Mergin Data](https://cssbook.net/content/chapter06.html#sec-join) and [R4DS Chapter 13: Relational Data](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html) for more information and examples. 

## Data

For this tutorial, we will look at data describing the US presidential primaries.
These data originate from the [MIT Election Lab](https://electionlab.mit.edu/data), 
but to make it easier a lightly preprocessed version is available from the repository of this tutorial.

There are two relevant files:

- [US_Demographics.csv](https://github.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/blob/master/data/US_Demographics.csv): Demographics per county, such as population, income, and percentage of the population without a college degree
- [US_Elections_2020.csv](https://github.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/blob/master/data/US_Elections_2020.csv): Election results per county per candidate

For many research questions, we need to be able to combine the data from these files. 
For example, we might want to know how Trump's performance relates to the proportion of unemployed, non-white, or college-educated people. 

### Downloading and preparing the data

Before we start, let's download the two data files:

```{r loaddemo, exercise=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
demographics <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/master/data/US_Demographics.csv")
demographics
```

```{r loadresult, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='tidy'}
results <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/master/data/US_Elections_2020.csv")
results
```

```{r tidy, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r loaddata, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
demographics <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/master/data/US_Demographics.csv")
results <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/master/data/US_Elections_2020.csv")
```

## Inner joins

The basic command for joining data in R is the `inner join`. 
It takes two data frames and joins it on any variable that occurs in both. 

It results in a new data frame with the information in both frames joined together.
For example, the code below joins the demographics and results data sets

```{r innerjoin, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='loaddata'}
inner_join(demographics, results)
```

This seems to work very well, but as you can see it now joins on all shared columns: state, county, and fips.
This could be problematic if there are for example spelling variations in the values of one of the columns on which the data is joined. 

In fact, take a look at the county with fips 1049 in both demographics and results data sets. What do you notice? 
Can you see this county in the result of the inner join?

```{r fips, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='loaddata'}
demographics |> filter(fips == 1049)
results |> filter(fips == 1049)

```

As you can see the County DeKalb is spelled DeKalb in the demographics data frame but it is spelled Dekalb in the results data frame. In such a case the inner_join function will not join this row and in fact leave it out the result data frame. Therefore it is important to be sure not only the columns are identical in the joined data frames, also the spelling of all possible values should be equal!

### Specifying columns

As we saw above, by default, joining is performed with all shared columns as joining *keys*.
If this is not correct, you can specify the joining key with the `by=` option.
This can be used to restrict joining only on the column(s) we want, e.g. on the FIPS column:

```{r by, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='loaddata'}
inner_join(demographics, results, by = "fips")
```

As you can see, this duplicates the variables for state to state.x and state.y, and the same for county. 
If this is not desirable, you can also remove these columns before joining:

```{r by2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='loaddata'}
results |> 
  select(-county, -state) |> 
  inner_join(demographics)
```

### Different column names

Another common use case is if the variable names are not the same. For example, lets say that  in the demographics data it was actually renamed to `county_fips`.
We can then specify `by=c("left_column"="right_column")` to join on two differently named columns.

```{r rename, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='loaddata'}
demographics_renamed <- rename(demographics, county_fips = fips)
inner_join(demographics_renamed, results, by=c("county_fips"="fips"))
```

(Of course, you could also first rename the column in either data.frame and then join them -- which is probably what I would do)

## Left and right joins

The function `inner_join` keeps only rows that occur in both data sets.
Thus, only rows with both an election result and demographics will be kept with the code used above. 
In fact, if you look at the results of the `inner_join` you see that there are about 200 missing data points if you compare it to the results data -- 
so apparently some results lacked the corresponding demographics.

In many cases, dropping such cases is desirable since these cases are probably not useful for analysis.
However, in some situations you might want to keep cases where either data frame does not have any rows.

For this, you can use `left_join`, `right_join`, and `full_join`. 
Their use is illustrated in the diagram below:

![Figure 3: Join types](https://cssbook.net/content/img/ch07_figjoins.png)

&nbsp;

As you can see, inner join keeps only data points that occur in both data sets (the blue intersection in the middle).
Left join, on the other hand, keeps all cases that occur in the 'left hand side' data, i.e. the first argument of the join.
Similarly, right join keeps all cases from the right. 
Outer (full) join, finally, keeps all cases.

### Performing left, right, and full joins

To illustrate these join types, lets consider some example data about candidates:


```{r toydata, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='tidy'}
age <- tibble(candidate = c("Trump", "Biden", "Hawkins"), 
              age = c(77, 80, 70))
party <- tibble(candidate = c("Trump", "Biden", "Jorgensen"),
                party = c("Republican", "Democrat", "Libertarian"))
age
party
```

```{r leftright-setup, exercise.setup='tidy', echo=FALSE}
age <- tibble(candidate = c("Trump", "Biden", "Hawkins"), 
              age = c(77, 80, 70))
party <- tibble(candidate = c("Trump", "Biden", "Jorgensen"),
                party = c("Republican", "Democrat", "Libertarian"))
```

As you can see, for Trump and Biden we have both age and party affiliation.
For the (green) candidate Hawkins, however, we are missing party affiliation data,
while for Jorgensen we are missing her age.

```{r leftright, exercise=TRUE}
inner_join(age, party)
```

As you can see, the result of `inner_join` keeps only the two candidates who occur in both data sets.

Change the join type to left, right, and full join, and observe the difference.
Does it make sense? 
What happens to the columns for which we don't have data?

## Investigating missing data

If we observe that an inner join causes data loss, we can investigate what caused it 
by doing a full join and checking for a `NA` value in a column that should not be empty:


```{r missing, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='loaddata'}
full_join(demographics, results, by="fips") |> filter(is.na(county.x))
```

What can you tell from these results?
Now check which rows are missing from the results data. What do these results mean?

### Anti and semi joins

As a final note, you can use `anti_join(d1, d2)` to select only those rows in d1 that don't exist in d2.
Similarly, `semi_join(d1, d2)` selects those rows from d1 that also exist in d2. 

Can you use anti_join to answer the same question as above, i.e. which `results` rows are missing demographics data?

```{r missing2, eval=FALSE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='loaddata'}
anti_join(___)
```
